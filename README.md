Improving model performance of shortest-path-based centrality measures in network models through scale space
This study proposes a more suitable metric for real-world networks by relaxing the shortest path algorithm."

For a more academic tone:
"This study introduces a modified shortest path algorithm to provide a more appropriate metric for real-world networks."

If "relaxing" is meant in a mathematical or algorithmic sense (as in optimization problems), "relaxing" is the correct term. 
However, if the meaning is more about adapting or modifying, then "modifying" or "extending" might be better choices.
